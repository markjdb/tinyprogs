I wrote this to look at vm_phys fragmentation caused by nofree zones.

Something like the following gives useful info:

$ ./umaslabs -m "VM OBJECT" | gawk '/^0x/{printf("0x%x\n", rshift(strtonum($1), 21));}' | sort | uniq -c

It relies on the fact that subpage items are accessed via the direct
map, so we can directly use the mapping address to measure fragmentation
of the underlying physical memory.
